# SQL_files_ItlabChallenge
## sql files to compose the challenge.

Once created a database, run files in the following order. Notice if you're using the new database:

1. tablesAndPk.sql
2. relationsAndFk.sql
3. vitalData.sql
4. testInserts
5. reports.sql

feel confortable to exec drops.sql at your will to drop all tables and start again later.
hope you enjoy it! ;)
